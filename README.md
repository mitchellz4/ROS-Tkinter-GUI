## Smart_AG GUI

This GUI was developed for our Bramblebee robot, it is a Husky base from Clear Path Robotics with a custom built platform on top of it that has a full computer, ZED 2I, Realsense Camera, Velodyne Lidar, PixyPro 180 Degree Camera, and a GPS Antenna. 

The GUI was coded in Python3 and the Tkinter GUI Package was used as well.
